* Updating the database

`db.items.updateOne({name: "Moto 30s"} , {$set: {price : 200}})` 
>> Here there are two parameters passed to the updateOne() --> The first parameter is filter object which is used to match the documnets in the items collection of panksKart database
--> And seconsd parameter says what to be updated if there is a match
--> So the above command updates the price of the first match with name as  "Moto 30s" to 200 (price is updated to 200)

`db.items.updateMany({name: "Moto 30s"}, {$set: {price: 399, sold: 300}})` --> This command updates the price to 399 and sold to 300 for
all the matches with name as "Moto 30s"

                                        Mongo DB

* It is a NO SQL database
* It is document oriented
* Open source, cross platform document oriented database written in C++

* Its salient features:
    - Develop faster
    - Deploy easier
    - Scale bigger

Q. What is document oriented database?

>>> - The database which stores data as document oriented is a document oriented database
    - MongoDB stores data as documents so it is known as a document oriented database
    - Data is stored is BSON in MongoDB. BSON is like a JSON but the difference is that in BSON the type of the variable is declared e.g the data is integer, string.

***
 
If we relate MongoDB and SQL based databases then here in MongoDB
- DATABASE is called same as DATABASE
- TABLES is called as COLLECTIONS (Not exacctly but can be referred as)
- ROWS is called as DOCUMENTS

*                                    mongod and mongo

- mongod and mongo are two processes

* mongod - is the host process for the database. If we run this it will start the database and it will start keeeping the data in the data directory.

* mongo - is the command line shell that connects to a specific instance of mongod. But suppose we don't have mongo command shell then we can connect to the instance of mongod using external applications like python, node.JS etc.

* When we run the mongo with no parameters it defaults to a specific to connecting to the localhost on port 27017.

* If we run mongo against an invalid host_machine:port combination then it will fail to connect.



Here in this system while learning we've installed Mongo atalas not as a service because we'll be launching it manually
everytime we'll need but
In production servers we install it as service.

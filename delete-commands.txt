* Deleting data from database

** Deleting single matching document 

`db.items.deleteOne({price: 22000})` --> This command will delete the first document which is matching with filter object {price: 22000}

** Deleting all the matching documnents

`db.items.deleteMany({price: 129000})`  --> this command will delete all the matching documents with price = 129000

Note: Delete command is like first searching and then Deleting, So we can pass the complex filter objects while deleOne() and deleteMany()

e.g.

`db.items.find({$and : [{price:129000}, {sold: 99}]})`
